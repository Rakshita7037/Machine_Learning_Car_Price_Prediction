# OLD CAR PRICE PREDICTION | MACHINE LEARNING | PYTHON
This project analyzed second hand car data to understand the factors influencing their selling prices and built a machine learning model to predict the price accurately. 
Key features like fuel type, transmission, make year, etc were key dependent variables to predict the results.

Old Car price data has been taken from Kaggle.
